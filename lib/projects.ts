A Lambda ingester pulls 90 days of Cost Explorer data into a DynamoDB single-table store daily, grouped by service and, in a second query, by the Project cost allocation tag so spend maps to an owner (untagged spend surfaces explicitly as No Project). The same ingester pulls RI and Savings Plans coverage and scans EC2 for waste: unattached EBS volumes, unassociated Elastic IPs, and gp2 volumes that should be gp3, each with an estimated monthly cost. A z-score analyzer flags per-service spend beyond 2.5σ of a 30-day rolling baseline and forecasts 14 days out; an AWS Budget (80% actual / 100% forecast) and an optional AWS-managed anomaly monitor back it up. Beyond cost per service, it derives unit economics from LLM traffic (cost per inference, cost per 1k tokens, and cache hit rate), the FinOps Run metric that scales with the business rather than the calendar, and a /focus endpoint normalizes every record to the FOCUS open cost-and-usage schema so it joins with the Azure dashboard on one schema for multi-cloud chargeback. Provider default_tags applies a canonical TitleCase tag set so nothing is created untagged, fixing the casing mismatch that had flagged every resource as non-compliant. Results are served through an API Gateway HTTP API to a React frontend on S3 behind CloudFront with Origin Access Control; four IAM execution roles enforce least privilege per layer.

An identical serverless order API (API Gateway v2 and Lambda in private-subnet-only VPCs with no IGW or NAT) runs in us-east-1 and us-west-2 over an RDS PostgreSQL primary with an encrypted cross-region read replica. A Route 53 health check probes the primary /health endpoint every 10 seconds, and failover routing answers with the standby endpoint the moment it fails. A CloudWatch alarm on the health check metric (which only exists in us-east-1) emits a state change that EventBridge forwards cross-region to the standby default bus, where a failover Lambda verifies the replica is promotable, calls PromoteReadReplica idempotently, and publishes what it did to SNS. Every response component lives in the standby region, so the machinery that answers a regional failure never depends on the failing region. Until promotion completes, the standby serves reads and returns an honest 409 on writes, which makes the promotion itself observable. Credentials live in Secrets Manager with cross-region replication reached through interface endpoints, TLS to PostgreSQL is verified against the RDS CA bundle, and the failover role can promote exactly one ARN. CI gates on Bandit, Checkov, and Trivy, with an OIDC-authenticated plan job and zero static keys. Verified end to end against real AWS: the primary was broken live, DNS answered with the standby region in about 60 seconds, the alarm-to-promotion automation fired in about 100 seconds, and the promoted standby accepted the write it had correctly refused minutes earlier. The whole stack was then destroyed the same night with zero residual billing, about a quarter for the full session. Built a second time on Azure to prove the pattern is not AWS-specific: Traffic Manager health-probes the primary every ten seconds while a PostgreSQL Flexible Server cross-region replica takes minutes to promote, the same two clocks on a different stack. There the database is Entra-only with password authentication disabled and a user-assigned managed identity is the administrator, so no password exists in code, config, or state, and one azurerm provider spans both regions where AWS requires aliased-provider ceremony.",

The demo script port-forwards Grafana, Prometheus, and AlertManager, then scales the sample app to zero to trip the target-down alert on cue. Both clouds were verified against the live Prometheus API with every scrape target reporting up, then torn down clean with zero residual billing, the Azure path removing resource group, cluster, and node VMSS together.

The win came from two specific decisions. The index column order was matched to the DISTINCT ON sort so Postgres consumes index order and skips the sort entirely, and the selected columns were carried in INCLUDE so both branches of the plan run index-only with Heap Fetches at zero. A partial index on availability measured worse and was rejected, because the API passes availability as a bind parameter and the planner cannot prove a partial predicate holds for an unknown parameter; the /v1/index endpoint does use one, since there the filter is a literal. Planner cost settings are treated as part of the tuning and applied to both the before and after runs, so the reported delta isolates the indexes rather than mixing in the cost-model change. Keyset pagination replaces OFFSET, which at depth fifty thousand is 3.4ms versus 0.7ms, because OFFSET walks and discards every preceding row no matter what indexes exist. Redis serves a read-through cache and a per-key token bucket, and both fail open: a Redis outage degrades to a direct database read rather than taking the API down. Under load the service sustains 1,114 requests per second at a p50 of 6.8ms and a p95 of 8.3ms with zero errors and a 99.7 percent cache hit ratio; the load harness fails its own run above a one percent error rate, after an early version reported flattering percentiles computed over thirteen thousand rate-limited requests.

Exceptions invert too: an SCP deny cannot be un-denied lower in the tree, so AWS exceptions mean moving an account to another OU, while a GCP list constraint lets a child policy widen an inherited one, demonstrated here by allowing US locations at the org and adding EU for nonprod alone without weakening anything elsewhere. Nine constraints attach at the organization root rather than a folder, since a folder-scoped policy is bypassed by creating a project somewhere else: no service account keys, no default network, no serial port access, OS Login required, no public Cloud SQL, uniform bucket access, no external IPs on VMs, and approved locations only. A tenth, domain restricted sharing, ships deliberately disabled because it blocks binding allUsers and would break any public Cloud Run service, and naming that trade-off in code is worth more than silently enforcing one side of it. Every project is vended through one factory, so no project can exist without a folder, a billing link, data access audit logs, and the default network suppressed; the two workload projects are identical except for placement, which is the whole demonstration. A Shared VPC host project owns the network while workload projects attach as service projects and receive access per subnet rather than per project, with explicit default-deny ingress and SSH permitted only from the IAP forwarding range, so there is no public SSH path and no VM carries an external IP. An organization sink with include_children ships admin activity, data access, system event, and policy denial logs to a partitioned BigQuery dataset and covers projects created after the sink exists, with partition expiry bounding retention and cost together.

The question worth answering is whether the checks actually ran on these exact bytes, and the only durable answer is a signature made by something that could not have signed unless they passed. Cloud Build builds a container, resolves the tag to a digest and works only on the digest from then on, runs a synchronous on-demand Artifact Analysis scan, and signs with a Cloud KMS asymmetric key only when nothing blocking comes back; Binary Authorization on Cloud Run then refuses any digest that signature does not cover. The gate is the step ordering rather than a conditional, since Cloud Build stops on the first failing step, so there is nothing inside the signing step to bypass. Two projects split the trust boundary: the signing key, registry, scanner, and attestor live in the build project while the deployment policy lives in the runtime project, whose Binary Authorization service agent holds attestorsVerifier on the attestor and nothing more, so verifying and signing are different permissions on different resources in different projects and bypassing the gate requires compromising both. If they shared a project, anyone who could edit the policy could mint the signature satisfying it.

This rebuilds that second question at the API across three services. Access Context Manager defines what a trusted request looks like as a named object rather than as policy text, so an IAM condition references it by name and changing the definition of trusted is one edit rather than an audit of every policy that inlined an aws:SourceIp equivalent. Identity-Aware Proxy is enabled directly on the Cloud Run service rather than through a load balancer, protecting the run.app endpoint for nothing instead of about twenty dollars a month of infrastructure in front of a container that scales to zero, and the grant it enforces is conditioned on the access level, so losing the trusted context revokes access without the role changing and without the application knowing a policy exists. VPC Service Controls does the part with no honest equivalent on AWS or Azure: the perimeter is an object containing projects, so a resource is protected from the moment it exists, inverting a model where the boundary is conditions written into each resource policy and a bucket created without them is silently outside. The demonstration is a comparison rather than a refusal. A service account holding a real roles/storage.objectViewer on exactly that bucket, impersonated rather than keyed, is refused from a laptop with a VPC-SC violation ID while the same identity reads the same object cleanly from an instance inside the perimeter that has no public address, no NAT, and no SSH key, reachable only through the IAP TCP tunnel with OS Login binding SSH to IAM. Two access levels exist because they fail differently: the trusted level combines identity and network and gates the application, while a management level with no network condition gates perimeter ingress, a deliberate weakening on the reasoning that the ability to remove a control must survive that control being wrong. State lives in a seed project outside the perimeter for the same reason. Applied in dry run first, which immediately caught the VM guest agent calling an API the enforced config would have broken silently, and the live run surfaced a subtler one: under enforcement Terraform could not manage the bucket while plain gcloud as the same user could, because user_project_override attached a quota project outside the perimeter to calls against resources inside it, a RESOURCES_NOT_IN_SAME_SERVICE_PERIMETER refusal that no ingress rule can admit and that is fixed with a second provider rather than a looser policy. Deployed, demonstrated, and destroyed the same day for under a dollar, with the organization-scoped objects that outlive the project written into the teardown.",

This builds both on one cluster and shows the difference rather than asserting it. Delete a ResourceQuota out of a tenant namespace and Config Sync puts it back in about five seconds; flip one boolean and the identical command from the identical account is refused by an admission webhook and never reaches etcd. Reconciliation is eventual consistency with a measurable window, admission control is a control, and the window is the whole distinction: for those seconds the quota did not exist and any pod admitted in that gap was admitted without it. That is fine for a quota and it is not fine for everything. The cluster is zonal GKE with private nodes, Workload Identity, and a Cloud NAT that exists solely because the reconciler polls github.com over the internet rather than over a Google API path, which makes it load bearing rather than incidental. Terraform builds the cluster and enables the fleet features and manages no object inside it, so a bad namespace change is a revert and one sync interval rather than an apply. Config Sync reconciles a config directory from this public repo with no credential at all, because the repo is public over HTTPS and secret_type is none, which forces the discipline that configuration carries no secrets. Policy Controller runs the full constraint template library with three constraints: two enforcing, and one deliberately left in dry run so its recorded violations answer the question that cannot be answered any other way, which is what turning it on would break. The dry-run constraint is a hand-written ConstraintTemplate requiring image digests, and it flags the sample app that is running right now on a tagged image. Both features are fleet features rather than open source installs, which only became the cheaper option in September 2025 when Google dissolved the GKE Enterprise tier and moved Config Sync, Policy Controller, Fleets, and Connect Gateway into base GKE at no cost; the open source path is now actively worse, since kpt-config-sync publishes no release assets and the manifest bucket its own documentation points at no longer serves ordinary callers. The live run corrected the build in ways review had not. The privileged-pod test was refused by Pod Security Admission rather than by the constraint it named, because PSA runs inside the API server ahead of every validating webhook, which means that test could never have proven Policy Controller works no matter how it was written. Deployed, demonstrated across six acts, and destroyed the same day for about a dollar.",

The measurement only means something if the two runs are the same computation, so the same binary solves the same 2D heat equation over the same 8192 grid for the same 500 iterations at the same four ranks, and the checksum comes back 1.073498e+07 on both fabrics. Over ordinary ENA the job spends 17.5 percent of its time blocked on halo exchange; over EFA it spends 0.8 percent, which is communication time falling by roughly nineteen times. Wall clock went up rather than down, from 18.8 to 21.0 seconds, because a c5n core is older and slower than a c6i core, and reporting the speedup on wall time would have been reporting the CPU rather than the fabric. That is the entire reason the job prints a communication fraction. The workload is a real stencil with a 1D row decomposition where every rank trades boundary rows with its neighbours before it can compute, using MPI_Sendrecv rather than paired blocking sends that deadlock the moment a message outgrows the eager threshold, and the test that guards it asserts the invariant that a domain-decomposed stencil must produce an identical checksum at 1, 2, 4, and 8 ranks, because a broken halo exchange computes against stale boundary rows while every job still exits zero. Terraform owns the VPC, FSx for Lustre, S3, IAM, and the accounting database while ParallelCluster owns only the cluster, since letting the scheduler create its own network and filesystem puts a NAT gateway and 1.2 TiB of Lustre outside state, which is exactly how they survive a teardown and keep billing. Both queues sit at MinCount zero, so an idle cluster is a head node and nothing else, and the EFA nodes at $1.94 an hour each exist only while a job holds them. Nothing carries a public IP or an open port 22: the head node is private and driven over SSM, and the demo uses send-command rather than an interactive session, so it needs no TTY, no key material, and no session-manager-plugin. Nothing in the repository had ever been run against AWS before this deploy, and the first real run found eleven defects, which is the part worth reading.",

The part worth reading is the measurement. DCGM_FI_DEV_GPU_UTIL, the gauge on every GPU dashboard, reports the fraction of time at least one kernel was resident on the device, not how much of the device was working, so a single small kernel looping on one streaming multiprocessor pins it at 100 percent while the rest of the card idles. On a g6e.xlarge running a real CUDA load that gauge read 100 percent while SM occupancy read 45.82 percent, and of the $0.031017 that interval cost, $0.016805 bought nothing. The collector prices every sample that way, per GPU per interval, from Pricing API rates and observed instance-seconds rather than Cost Explorer, which reports daily and lags up to a day and therefore cannot see a three-hour GPU demo at all. An idle-GPU reaper keys on occupancy rather than the gauge, holds on four independent checks, and ships in dry-run because an autonomous terminator of expensive hardware that has never been watched is a liability. Nothing here had ever run against AWS before this deploy, and the first real run found twenty defects, about half of which made the project impossible to deploy and the rest of which let the demo report success while proving nothing.",

A developer describes a resource in plain language and Claude on Bedrock maps that intent onto a fixed catalog of vetted Terraform modules, calling deterministic tools rather than authoring HCL or inventing prices, so the model's whole job is to remove the requirement that the developer already know which of N modules and which instance family they need. Every consequential decision is code, not model output. A right-sizing engine picks the cheapest option that still fits: Graviton over x86, burstable for bursty non-latency-critical workloads, Fargate Spot for non-prod stateless services, nightly auto-stop for non-prod, gp3 and KMS always. A hardened-compute golden path provisions an EC2 host from a CIS-hardened AMI baked by an in-repo EC2 Image Builder pipeline, IMDSv2-only, no public IP, SSM access instead of SSH, with all egress routed through the shared Palo Alto VM-Series firewall for inspection. A cost tool prices it from Infracost when the binary is present and a static table otherwise, region-aware through a per-region multiplier. A budget gate checks the estimate against the team's monthly envelope and returns ok, warn, or over. An OPA/Rego policy denies missing tags, unencrypted storage, un-approved GPUs, over-budget requests, un-hardened production databases, and any compute host that would launch with a public IP, without IMDSv2, without firewall-inspected egress, or from a non-hardened AMI, and it carries fireable fixtures with a base-passes case so every deny rule is proven to fire rather than passing vacuously. The output is a pull request with the cost delta, the right-sizing rationale, and the policy result in the body, never a direct apply, so a human always reviews the diff before anything is created. On Bedrock the model call authenticates with IAM and SigV4, so there is no API key to store or leak, the same posture the tool enforces on everything it provisions, and model access itself was enabled from the CLI through the Bedrock model-agreement API rather than the console. The same determinism boundary drives a waste-reclamation loop that closes the FinOps loop the cost dashboard only informs on: it pulls idle-spend findings (unattached EBS, gp2 volumes, stray Elastic IPs) from a fixture or the dashboard's live /waste endpoint and opens a reviewed cleanup PR, gated so unattributed waste (no CostCenter tag) and destructive deletions are held for approval while safe gp2-to-gp3 migrations ship, driven live through the Bedrock loop with the model refusing to self-approve. The deterministic pipeline is covered by unit and policy tests plus an offline scenario sweep that exercises the burstable, production-hardened, spot, storage, and over-budget paths, so the whole flow runs and is verifiable with no AWS credentials at all.",

Palo Alto is an opt-in VM-Series next-generation firewall placed in front of the hardened jump host in azure-vm-hardening: management, untrust, and trust interfaces, with a user-defined route forcing the jump host's default route through the firewall trust IP and the subnet NSG kept behind it as defense in depth, plus a separate Terraform root module that configures least-privilege egress policy on the running appliance through the official panos provider. Fortinet is an opt-in FortiGate-VM added to the azure-landing-zone hub as a network virtual appliance in its own untrust and trust subnets, with route tables forcing both spoke workload subnets' egress through the FortiGate trust interface so all north-south traffic is inspected at one chokepoint, correcting for the fact that a third-party NVA cannot live in AzureFirewallSubnet. Both firewalls were deployed against real Azure and verified live, sequentially rather than together because the subscription's ten-vCPU regional cap cannot hold an eight-vCPU VM-Series and the FortiGate at once, and the first real deploy surfaced six distinct defects (an ed25519 key the managed-image path rejects, three separate quota and capacity walls, a Gen1 image that will not boot a Gen2-only size, and a NIC-count ceiling) that are now baked into the defaults.

The module builds three S3 zones (raw, curated, scripts), each with SSE-KMS from one customer-managed key with rotation on, a public-access block on all four settings, and a bucket policy that denies any request not made over TLS; a Glue PySpark job capped at 2 DPUs on an IAM role scoped to only the buckets and the one key it touches; an Athena database standing in for Redshift; and an Object-Locked, versioned evidence bucket where every deploy writes its Terraform plan so the change record cannot be overwritten or deleted. The conftest/OPA gate reads the plan as JSON and rejects untagged resources, an oversized Glue job, a missing encryption block, or any public-access flag before a dollar is spent, and it is tier-aware: the same module promotes through sandbox, dev, test, and prod as separate Terraform workspaces with per-tier var-files, dev allowing a higher DPU ceiling for experimentation while prod additionally requires an Object-Lock evidence-retention floor to clear an audit bar. The point is that the gate that blocks a surprise $15k job is the same gate that produces the change-control audit trail a SOC 2 and GxP shop lives under, so cost hygiene and compliance turn out to be one control rather than two. Two of the controls are proven live rather than asserted: make verify shows a plain-HTTP GET returning 403 denied by the bucket policy, and the restricted-reader role reading the raw zone but denied on curated, which is an IAM decision and not an encryption artifact because the role holds kms:Decrypt. The idle cost was engineered down on purpose, Athena instead of a Redshift cluster and local Airflow instead of MWAA at roughly $350 a month, so the only standing charge is the KMS key at about a dollar a month; deployed live, verified end to end, then destroyed with a governance-bypass sweep that clears the Object-Locked zone first.",
