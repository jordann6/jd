An identical serverless order API (API Gateway v2 and Lambda in private-subnet-only VPCs with no IGW or NAT) runs in us-east-1 and us-west-2 over an RDS PostgreSQL primary with an encrypted cross-region read replica. A Route 53 health check probes the primary /health endpoint every 10 seconds, and failover routing answers with the standby endpoint the moment it fails. A CloudWatch alarm on the health check metric (which only exists in us-east-1) emits a state change that EventBridge forwards cross-region to the standby default bus, where a failover Lambda verifies the replica is promotable, calls PromoteReadReplica idempotently, and publishes what it did to SNS. Every response component lives in the standby region, so the machinery that answers a regional failure never depends on the failing region. Until promotion completes, the standby serves reads and returns an honest 409 on writes, which makes the promotion itself observable. Credentials live in Secrets Manager with cross-region replication reached through interface endpoints, TLS to PostgreSQL is verified against the RDS CA bundle, and the failover role can promote exactly one ARN. CI gates on Bandit, Checkov, and Trivy, with an OIDC-authenticated plan job and zero static keys. Verified end to end against real AWS: the primary was broken live, DNS answered with the standby region in about 60 seconds, the alarm-to-promotion automation fired in about 100 seconds, and the promoted standby accepted the write it had correctly refused minutes earlier.

A cross-region read replica cannot take writes until it is promoted to a standalone server, which takes minutes, the slow clock. Between the two, the standby region serves traffic but its database is still read-only, and the API is honest about it: reads succeed while writes return HTTP 409 with a message that writes resume after promotion, making the exact state of the failover observable rather than hidden. Everything that answers a regional failure lives in the standby: the metric alert action group, the failover function, and the promotion role assignment, so nothing needed for recovery is lost with the failed region. PostgreSQL is Entra-only with password authentication disabled, and a single user-assigned managed identity is the database administrator, so no password exists in code, config, or Terraform state.

The win came from two specific decisions. The index column order was matched to the DISTINCT ON sort so Postgres consumes index order and skips the sort entirely, and the selected columns were carried in INCLUDE so both branches of the plan run index-only with Heap Fetches at zero. A partial index on availability measured worse and was rejected, because the API passes availability as a bind parameter and the planner cannot prove a partial predicate holds for an unknown parameter; the /v1/index endpoint does use one, since there the filter is a literal. Planner cost settings are treated as part of the tuning and applied to both the before and after runs, so the reported delta isolates the indexes rather than mixing in the cost-model change. Keyset pagination replaces OFFSET, which at depth fifty thousand is 3.4ms versus 0.7ms, because OFFSET walks and discards every preceding row no matter what indexes exist. Redis serves a read-through cache and a per-key token bucket, and both fail open: a Redis outage degrades to a direct database read rather than taking the API down.
